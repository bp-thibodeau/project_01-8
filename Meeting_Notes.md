### Meeting 1

Project goals:
1. build the equations of motion using Lagrange and least action: Brooke gets Lagrange expression, Ameet solves eq motion
2. solve for the motion for a slow rotation speed and a fast rotation speed: Anthony, Quentin
3. visualize the solution with plots and animations: Julianna, Franbelle

We'll all make branches/forks for our code as needed
We'll touch base on Friday via text
